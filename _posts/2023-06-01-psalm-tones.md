### What is a psalm tone?
A psalm tone is a melodic formula used for chanting psalms and canticles. It is typically used for singing of psalms in the Divine Office, but it can also be used in the mass for adapting texts to simple melodies. There are eight Gregorian psalm tones, one for each mode, plus a ninth tonus peregrinus. The psalm tones work best with Latin text, but can be adapted for English as well. There are also other psalm tones specifically composed to be used with English text. Here I will explain how to read the chant pointing as is commonly used in the Solesmes and Vatican chant books.

### Parts of a psalm tone

**Reciting note:** The note on which most of the text is recited on. Also known as the dominant or tenor.

**Intonation:** The notes at the beginning of the psalm tone leading to the reciting note. When singing psalms, the intonation is only sung on the first verse. Subsequent verses go straight to the reciting note. The exception is for the gospel canticles like the Magnificat, where the intonation is sung on every verse.

**Flex:** The flex is marked by a cross or dagger (†) before the quarter bar line. It is called flex because the note “flexes” down to a lower note from the reciting note. The flex is only found when the text is very long. It is only applied on the weak syllables of the word before the †.

**Mediation:**  The melodic cadence found at the end of the first half of the tone, before the full bar line. Marked by a *.

**Termination:** The final cadence found at the end of the second half of the tone. For each psalm tone, there can be many different terminations.

**Accent mark:** Marks the accented syllables of the words in the mediation and termination.

**Hollow note (or punctum cavum):** This is denoted by a white square, and is for any extra syllables; they are sung on this note.
Normally only the texts are provided with markings on them (e.g. italics and bolded syllables), instead of having the text notated with the full score. 

The markings help indicate when there is a change in the notes. This is also known as “pointing” the text. Often, editors will have different ways of pointing in order to better fit the word accents of the text. They may also use different symbols for the markings. Once we learn how to read one way of pointing, it will not be too difficult to figure out other variations. 

### An example

Let’s look at an example with a mode I psalm tone.
First, try to identify the parts of the psalm tone.
<img src="/chant/img/posts/psalmtone-2.png" alt="Mode 1 Psalm Ton" width="70%">

The Lord’s revelation to my Master: †  
‘**Sit** on **my** right: *  
your foes I will put *beneath* **your** feet.’

Next, we figure out what each line sounds like. There are no markings for the intonation. The syllables in italic indicate a change in the note from the reciting note. Bolded syllables indicate where the accented note is sung.

**First line:** We start with the intonation on the words “The Lord’s”, then onto the reciting note. The flex note at the end of the first line is only applied to “ster”, which is the weak syllable of the word “Master”.

**Second line:** The * at the end tells us this line ends in the mediation. The first word “sit” is in bold, this means that we go straight into the mediation and there are no words on the reciting note here.

**Third line:** The last line starts off on the reciting note and the termination begins on “beneath”.

Put it all together and this is what it looks like fully notated:

### Chanting in practice
Traditionally, the psalms are chanted between two alternating choirs. The psalm starts with the intonation sung by the Precentor (Cantor) through to the mediation at the *. Then the rest of the first choir joins in until the end. The second verse is then sung entirely by the second choir. The two choirs alternate between verses for the rest of the psalm.  

At the flex, a quick breath may be taken if needed. At the *, a full breath and distinct pause is taken before continuing. At the end of each verse, the alternating choir starts the next verse smoothly without a pause.  

The psalms should be sung lightly, smoothly, gracefully and never too slowly. The words are to be read distinctly and naturally, without rushing. Accents in the words should take precedence over suggested accents in the music.
